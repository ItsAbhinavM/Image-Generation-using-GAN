# Image Generation using GAN

A small deep learning project on image generation using Generative Adversarial Network or GAN in short. The model is trained on [Wiki Arts](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/steubk/wikiart) dataset on a single class `Cubism`.
<br/>
The model used here is `DCGAN` or `Deep Convolution Generative Adversarial Network`, trained over 50 epochs with a Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) score of 220. The performance can be increased on higher epochs but you have to be very patient since this process takes time. If you have a better GPU try runnng it locally otherwise go for Kaggle.
